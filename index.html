            <p>Balatro may be the most addicting and fun game to ever exist. Everything about it just pulls you in and makes you want to go “one more run.” There is a good reason YouTuber Bricky said in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z15t-WaQxI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balatro review</a>, “I'm scared to recommend it because if [Balatro] sees massive mainstream appeal, the average individual's productivity will diminish minimum 36%.” Balatro appeals to our primal instincts of gambling and seeing big number go up, and because of that, it's the best game ever made. Don't be intimidated by the description of “poker-based deckbuilding roguelite”—this article will help you see the light of Balatro.</p>
            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>In Balatro, you start with a classic 52-card deck, draw a hand of eight cards, and play poker hands. Each hand has base chips and a multiplier (referred to as mult in-game), and each card adds chips. Each round, you have a blind with a set score required to pass. Your goal is to score enough chips within the amount of hands you have to beat the blind. Each blind gives you some reward money, and you also get money for each unused hand and interest for money you already have.</p>

            </aside>
            <p>And then you get to the shop.</p>
            <p>The shop is where you can upgrade pretty much everything in your run. You can buy booster packs that can contain upgraded cards, planet cards that upgrade your poker hands, tarot cards that do all sorts of things like upgrading cards and giving you money, and spectral cards that give ridiculous buffs like turning all cards in your hand into a random suit.</p>
            <p>However, the big thing in the shop are the jokers. What jokers you get in the shop define your run. With 150 different jokers you can find jokers for pretty much everything, ranging from adding 12 mult if you play a straight to having each king held in hand give a 1.5x multiplier on your mult.</p>

            <h2>Balatro has infinite replayability</h2>
            <p>There is a lot of stuff you can unlock in Balatro: 150 jokers, 15 decks, eight stakes (difficulties), 20 challenges, and secret poker hands; and yet, it never feels too overwhelming to unlock everything. The amount of stuff there is to get also means you will almost never have two runs that are alike. You're always playing new runs, unlocking new jokers and decks, and finding cool synergies you didn't see before.</p>
            <p>The soundtrack of Balatro also adds to its replayability. Even though there's only one song, it's so well created that I could genuinely listen to it forever. It's almost hypnotic.</p>
            <h2>Skill diff: Balatro has it</h2>
            Being a card game, Balatro naturally has some variance, but that doesn't mean the game is largely based on luck. 
            <aside class="left">

                    <figcaption>The scores when you get deep in a run can get pretty high.</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </aside>
            Getting far in a run is very reliant on skill. You might go into a run thinking you're going to play face cards, but then a Hack joker pops into the shop and you have to pivot to fours and fives. Recognizing when to pivot strategies, managing your money, and correctly choosing which cards to upgrade all take skill.
            <h2>Go buy the game already</h2>
            <p>The satisfying dings of scoring, the excitement when you hit the 1-in-4 Wheel of Fortune, the anticipation when you find the joker you needed in the shop, the satisfaction when you play your big hand and score 100 million chips (not an exaggeration btw)—it's all expertly created to maximize the dopamine rush and keep you playing; and I accept it with open arms.</p>
